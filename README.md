# Virtual Tourist
Virtual Tourist is resulting project of _iOS Persistence and Core Data_ course and is the penultimate project of Udacity's **iOS Developer Nanodegree** program. 
The app allows users to drop a pin on a map, and then download images for the location via **Flickr API**. Images as well as the associated URL and coordinates of the location are persisted via the **CoreData** framework. Users are also able to download a new collection of pictures and delete any existing pins if they so desire.

## Requirements
